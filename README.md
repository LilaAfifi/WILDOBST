Here you can find the file of all of my R based data cleaning and analyses conducted in the WILDOBST project. Torminalis Analyses.Rmd concerns the paper titled: Monitoring genetic diversity of Torminalis glaberrima for resilient forests in the face of population fragmentation 
The file itself is annotated but not the cleanest and therefore if there are any questions please feel free to reach out and ask directly
Future uploaded files will be better annotated
